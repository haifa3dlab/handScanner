For Arduino code:
===========

Electric components:
- 2 stepper moters (up to 12V - check)
- adafruit 2-stepper board (https://www.adafruit.com/product/81)
- power supply (12V, 3.5A)
- 2 limit-switches  (0-angle, max-height)
- 2 press button - "do full scan" and "emergency stop"

Considerations:
- All angle units are in degrees
  and all height units are in mm
- The arduino sketch should have params 
     to translate degrees and height to stepper steps.

Params:
- BASE_STEPS_PER_ANGLE_DEGREE
- BASE_MAX_ANGLE
- CAMERA_STEPS_PER_MM
- CAMERA_MAX_DIST

- Initialization:
1) Base - rotate to negative direction till angle limit switch is ON
2) Height - move camera up till height limit switch is ON

Global vars:
- angular_speed
- vertical_speed

Main functionalities:
1) turn(angle_diff) - should not surpass min/max limits
2) verticalMove(height_diff) - should not surpass min/max limits
3) setAngularSpeed(degrees_per_sec)
4) setHeightSpeed(mm_per_sec)
5) doFullScan()
6) emergencyStop()
