// include files:
params.scad - all parametric params to change sizes and tollerances (except for TurnPlate_wBearings)
util.scad - several usefull reuseable basic modules
torusPart.scad - just to generate full-circle or arc of torus 

// models from external sources:
TimingBelt.scad - models of GT3 time-belts and their pulleys (has commented-out params for GT2 - never checked)
M4_NutHolder_2020Tslot.scad - change nut_num_x and nut_num_y to generate many nut-holders to fasten M4-nuts to 2020-profile T-slots

// my main code:
TurnPlate.scad - with glass-balls
TurnPlate_wBearings.scad - with 4 bearings  (all its params are at the beginning of the file)

make_pulley.scad - very short - only to generate central pulley ("pulley.stl") for TurnPlate.scad (see command inside)
// note: the pulley for TurnPlate_wBearings ("pulley_r35.3.stl") is generates from inside TurnPlate_wBearings.scad

holders.scad - various small addapters and connectors for 2020-T-slot profile, 8mm rods, lower stepper,
                             linear_beraing, fasten_plates (to fasten 8mm rod holders and more), camera_cart, counter_weight_cart

sketch.scad - general mechanic sketch of the project, contains at least two versions (First version and ver2)


To build the STLs you need:
1. to find it in its specific scad file
2. uncomment the line which generates it (comment out other generated objects)
3. press F6 and after rendering "Export as STL"

The only dependency between STLs is that TurnPlate and TurnPlate_wBearings
  depend on pulley.stl and pulley_r35.3.stl respectively.
